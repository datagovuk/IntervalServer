<h2>Interval URI Set Test Page</h2>

<h3>This is an experimental site it is unstable and could disappear
or change at anytime and without notice.</h3>

<p>If your are using Firefox, fire up the Tabulator extension and
then try a couple of the URIs</p>

<p><a href='cal/id/calendar-month/1582-10'>October 1582</a>, the month
of the Julian to Gregorian change over</p>

<p>URI have the following forms which designate <em>calendar-aligned</em> intevals:</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td>id/calendar-year/{year}</td>
		<td>A specific 1 year interval.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>id/calendar-half/{year}-H{half}</td>
		<td>A specific 6 month interval.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>id/calendar-quarter/{year}-Q{quarter}</td>
		<td>A specific 3 month interval.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>id/calendar-month/{year}-{month}</td>
		<td>A specific 1 month interval.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>id/calendar-day/{year}-{month}-{day}</td>
		<td>A specific 1 day interval.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>id/calendar-hour/{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}</td>
		<td>A specific 1 hour interval.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>id/calendar-minute/{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{minute}</td>
		<td>A specific 1 minute interval.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>id/calendar-second/{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{minute}:{second}</td>
		<td>A specific 1 second interval.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>Syntactic contraints on field values are intended to align with
ISO 8601 syntax, with the deliberate omission of timezones (for now).
 Syntactic constraints are as follows (in addition requests for
non-existant dates will result in 404 responses).</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td>{year:[1-9][0-9]*}</td>
		<td>Year in as decimal number without leading zeros</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>{half:[12]}</td>
		<td>First or Second Half Year</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>{quarter:[1234]}</td>
		<td>First through forth Quarter</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>{month:[0-1][0-9]}</td>
		<td>Two digit month of year, starting with "01" for January</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>{day:[0-3][0-9]}</td>
		<td>Two digit day of month, starting with "01" as the first day
		of the given month.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>{hour:[0-3][0-9]}</td>
		<td>Two digit hour of day, starting with "00" as the first hour
		of a given day.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>{minute:[0-5][0-9]}</td>
		<td>Two digit minute of hour, starting with "00" as the first
		minute of a given hour.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>{second:[0-3][0-9]}</td>
		<td>Two digit second of minute, starting with "00" as the first
		second of a given hour.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>
These URI are intended to denote particular aggregation periods for
statistical data sets and it is not clear that the need to be strongly
grounded in a zoned time-line. For example it would be relevant to cite
a given month (or indeed month of year - but that is for later) as being
a period of aggregation for statistical purposes without being
absolutely grounded in a zoned timeline. That would allow statistics for
the same month to be tabulated across geographies without having to be
overly specific about the exact start and end time of each aggregation.</p>
